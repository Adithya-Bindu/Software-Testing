                                                        ------------------------

INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE TESTING
--------------------------------
Software Testing is a process of verifying and validating whether the Software Product or Application is working as expected or not. The
complete testing includes identifying errors and bugs that cause future problems for the performance of an application.

Software Testing Can be Divided into Two Steps:

1. Verification: This step involves checking if the software is doing what is supposed to do. Its like asking, "Are we building the 
   product the right way?"
2. Validation: This step verifies that the software meets the customer's needs and requirements. It's like asking, "Are we building the
   right product?"


What is Manual Testing?
Manual testing is a type of testing in which we do not use any tools or automation to perform the testing. In this testing, testers make
test cases for the codes test the software, and give the final report about that software. Manual testing is time-consuming testing 
because humans do it and there is a chance of human errors.

* Manual testing is conducted to discover bugs in the developed software application.
* The tester checks all the essential features of the application.
* The tester executes test cases and generates test reports without any help from the automation tools.
* It is conducted by the experienced tester to accomplish the testing process.

When to Perform Manual Testing?
Manual testing is done when automation can't be used or isn't enough. Here are key reasons and scenarios:

* Exploratory Testing: Discovering issues in new or unclear features by exploring them.
* Usability Testing: Checking if the UI is easy to use and looks good.
* Ad-Hoc Testing: Doing quick, informal tests after updates or bug fixes.
* Visual/GUI Testing: Checking the layout, colors, or how the site looks across different browsers.

Manual testing should be conducted when:

* Flexibility is required: With manual tests, QA can quickly test and provide fast feedback.
* Short-term projects: It is not advisable to invest more money and effort to set up short-term projects that focus on minor features
  because such setup will require huge effort and money that would be too high for such small projects.
* When testing end-user usability: Humans can use their sensibilities to understand the application behavior if the application offers a 
  satisfactory user journey. No machine can perform this task as humans can.

Benefits of Manual Testing -
Here are the Benefits of Manual Testing:

* Easy hiring: In manual testing, anyone can test so it helps in easy hiring.
* Fast feedback: Manual testing helps to provide fast and accurate feedback.
* Versatile: Manual test cases can be applied to many test cases.
* Flexible: Manual testing is flexible as it can adapt easily to changes in the user interface.
* Less expensive: Manual testing is less expensive as one does not need to spend a budget on automation tools and processes.

Limitations of Manual Testing - 
Here are the Limitations of Manual Testing:

* Not all defects detected: In manual cases, there is no assurance that there will be 100% test coverage as a result some of the defects
  may not be detected.
* High expertise: Although manual testing can be done by anyone, in some complex cases high expertise is required.
* Lots of time: Manual testing times extensive activity. It requires a lot of time to manually develop test cases so that all the 
  functionalities are covered and tested.
* Cannot be recorded: Manual testing process cannot be recorded so it is not possible to reuse the manual test cases.
* Less reliable: Manual testing is less reliable as it is conducted by humans and all test cases are designed by humans so there are 
  chances for human error.


What is Automation Testing?
Automation testing is a type of testing in which we take the help of tools (automation) to perform the testing. It is faster than manual 
testing because it is done with some automation tools. There is no chance of any human errors.

* It relies entirely on pre-scripted test which runs automatically to compare actual results with expected results.
* Automation testing helps the tester determine whether the application performs as expected or not.
* It allows the execution of repetitive tasks and regression tests.
* Automation requires manual effort to create initial testing scripts.

When to Perform Automation Testing?
* When need to run repetitive tasks: Automated tests are the best option in scenarios where there is a requirement to run repetitive tests.
  For example, in the case of regression tests must be executed periodically to make sure that the newly added code does not disrupt the 
  existing functionality of the software.
* When human resources are scarce: Automated tests are viable and the best option to get tests executed within deadlines when there are 
  only a limited number of dedicated testers.

Benefits of Automation Testing -
Here are Benefits of Automation Testing:

* Finds more bugs: Automation testing helps to find more bugs and defects in the software.
* Reduce time for regression tests: Automated tests are suitable for regression tests as the tests can be executed in a repetitive manner 
  periodically.
* The process can be recorded: This is one of the benefits of using automation tests as these tests can be recorded and thus allows to 
  reuse of the tests.
* No fatigue: As automation, tests are executed using software tools so there is no fatigue or tiring factor as in manual testing.
* Increased test coverage: Automation tests help to increase the test coverage as using the tool for testing helps to make sure that not
  even the smallest unit is left for testing.

Limitations of Automation Testing - 
Here are Limitations of Automation Testing:

* Difficult to inspect visual elements: In automated tests, it is difficult to get insight into the visual elements like color, font size,
  font type, button sizes, etc. as there is no human intervention.
* High cost: Automation tests have a high cost of implementation as tools are required for testing, thus adding the cost to the project 
  budget.
* Test maintenance is costly: In automation tests, test maintenance is costly.
* Not false proof: Automation tests also have some limitations and mistakes in automated tests can lead to errors and omissions.
* Trained employees required: For conducting automated tests, trained employees with knowledge of programming languages and testing 
  knowledge are required.


Conclusion:
In conclusion, both manual testing and automated testing play crucial roles in ensuring software quality. While manual testing excels in
exploratory testing and usability testing, automated testing shines in regression, performance, and load testing. The choice between them
depends on factors such as project requirements, timeline, budget, and the nature of the application being tested.
